                Our purpose is to provide people with a unique experience by enjoying an adventure through Recife through the waters of the Capibaribe and Beberibe Rivers, after all, the Atlantic Ocean begins at the meeting of these sister rivers
                We strongly believe that sailing these waters can be a memorable experience.

                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>
                    Our story began with Mr. Júlio Aguiar, grandfather of our current owner, Lucas Aguiar in 1957
                    'Seu Júlio', as he was known, was passionate about the rivers of Recife and also the city that is affectionately known as the Brazilian Venice
                    And it was from this passion that Recife Rafting was born and the passion has lasted for three generations of the family
                </p>
